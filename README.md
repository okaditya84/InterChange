# InterChange

InterChange is a web application designed exclusively for college students to facilitate productive discussions and connections. It allows users to post statuses about topics they'd like to discuss, and other students with common interests can engage in anonymous conversations to schedule in-person meetings.

## Features

- Anonymous Profiles: Users can create anonymous profiles without revealing personal information, promoting a safe and secure environment for discussions and meetings.
- Status Updates: Users can post statuses about the topics they'd like to discuss in a productive way.
- Matching System: The app matches users with common interests based on their posted statuses, enabling students to connect with others who share their passions.
- Chat Functionality: Once a user finds a relevant status update, they can engage in anonymous conversations to discuss the time, date, and venue for an in-person meeting.
- Enhanced Productivity: By bringing together students with similar interests, TopicConnect encourages productive discussions, helps students grow their knowledge, and fosters personal connections.
